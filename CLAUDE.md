Watch where they hesitate, where they click multiple times, where they give up.

Silence speaks louder than surveys.

## Deployment

The app is configured for Vercel deployment with external cron service for production automation.

### **🚧 THREADING SYSTEM CRON CONFIGURATION**

**⚡ NEW: 5-Minute Threading System**

Updated cron schedule to support optimal thread posting with reply chain management:

**1. Content Generation Cron:**
```bash
# Generate content every 2 hours for all accounts
0 */2 * * * GET https://gibbi-tweeter.vercel.app/api/generate
Authorization: Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}
```

**2. Auto-Posting Cron (UPDATED FOR THREADING):**
```bash
# Post content every 5 minutes - enables proper thread progression
*/5 * * * * POST https://gibbi-tweeter.vercel.app/api/auto-post
Authorization: Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}
```

**Threading Benefits:**
- **Thread Progression**: 5-minute intervals between thread tweets
- **Reply Chain Management**: Automatic parent tweet ID tracking
- **Mixed Content**: Threads, single tweets, and satirist content
- **Account Isolation**: Gibbi unchanged, Prince enhanced with threading
- **Timeout Compliance**: Each cron execution under 30-second limit

**Account-Specific Processing Benefits:**
- **Generation Isolation**: Slow AI generation for one account won't delay others
- **Custom Frequencies**: Different generation/posting rates per account strategy
- **Failure Isolation**: Account failures don't cascade to other accounts
- **Schedule Compliance**: Each account only processes during its scheduled hours (defined in `/lib/schedule.ts`)
- **Better Monitoring**: Per-account success/failure tracking
- **Timeout Prevention**: Individual account processing prevents system-wide timeouts

**Legacy Option: Multi-Account Processing**
```bash
# Process all accounts (less optimal but supported)
*/15 * * * * POST https://gibbi-tweeter.vercel.app/api/auto-post
Authorization: Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}
Body: {"process_all_accounts": true}
```

**Schedule Integration:**
- **Generation**: Only generates if persona scheduled in `/lib/schedule.ts` for current hour
- **Posting**: Only posts if persona scheduled in `/lib/schedule.ts` for current hour
- **Account Isolation**: Complete separation of credentials, data, and processing
- **Error Recovery**: Individual account failures without system impact

📚 Grammar Tip: "Who" vs "Whom" - Here's the simple trick that works every time:
If you can replace it with "he/she" → use WHO
If you can replace it with "him/her" → use WHOM

Example: WHO is calling? (He is calling ✓)
To WHOM are you speaking? (You are speaking to him ✓)

**Business Storytelling Thread (@princediwakar25):**
```
1/ Ratan Tata rejected Ford's $50B offer for Tata Motors in 2008.
His hands were shaking during the board meeting.
Here's the psychological pressure behind India's biggest business decision: 🧵

2/ Context: 2008 financial crisis hit hard.
Banks calling loans. Board members panicking.
"Sell everything to Ford and save the company," they urged.

3/ The internal conflict:
"If I sell, we'll never build Indian automotive capability.
But if I don't, 400,000 jobs are at risk."

4/ His decision: Rejected $50B. 
Restructured internally. Survived the crisis.
"Sometimes the right decision feels like the wrong one."

5/ Result: Jaguar-Land Rover now contributes 25% of Tata's revenue.
Lesson: Long-term vision often requires short-term courage.
