## MCP Servers

This project utilizes MCP (Multi-Connect Proxy) servers for development, particularly for interacting with services like Playwright and Neon through the Gemini CLI.

### 1\. Starting the MCP Servers

First, start the required MCP servers in separate terminal windows. They will run as background processes.

  - **Neon**: For connecting to the Neon database.

      - **Command**: `npx -y mcp-remote@latest https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp`

  - **Playwright**: For browser automation and testing.

      - **Command**: `npx @playwright/mcp`

When you run these commands, they will output the local proxy URL, which you'll need for the next step. For example, Neon might output `Proxy listening on http://localhost:53210`.

### 2\. Configuring Gemini CLI

To use these servers with the Gemini CLI, you need to add their proxy URLs to the Gemini settings file.

1.  **Locate or create the settings file**: The configuration is stored in `~/.gemini/settings.json`. If this file or directory doesn't exist, create it.

2.  **Add server configurations**: Open the file and add the server names and their corresponding proxy URLs from the previous step. The file should look like this:

    ```json
    {
      "servers": {
        "neon": "http://localhost:53210",
        "playwright": "http://localhost:53211"
      }
    }
    ```

    > **Note**: Replace `http://localhost:53210` and `http://localhost:53211` with the actual URLs provided by the MCP commands when you start them.

### 3\. Using MCP Servers with Gemini CLI

Once configured, you can route commands through a specific MCP server by prefixing your Gemini command with the server name followed by `/`.

  - **Example with Neon**: To run a `psql` command through the Neon MCP server, use:

    ```bash
    gemini neon/ psql -U <user> -h <host> -d <database>
    ```

    This command securely tunnels your `psql` connection through the Neon proxy.

  - **Example with Playwright**: To run a test script using Playwright through its MCP server:

    ```bash
    gemini playwright/ npx playwright test
    ```

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # Start development server (with Turbopack)
npm run build      # Build for production
npm run start      # Start production server
npm run lint       # Run ESLint
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Pre-Commit Requirements

**ALWAYS run the build before committing and pushing:**

```bash
npm run build      # Must pass before committing
npm run lint       # Must pass before committing
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
```
