## Core Architecture Changes

### Database Schema with Parent Tweet Tracking

#### Enhanced Database Schema
```sql
-- New threads table with complete tracking
CREATE TABLE threads (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  account_id UUID REFERENCES accounts(id),
  title VARCHAR(255),
  persona VARCHAR(100),
  story_template VARCHAR(100),
  total_tweets INTEGER,
  current_tweet INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  parent_tweet_id VARCHAR(100), -- Twitter ID of first tweet in thread
  status VARCHAR(50), -- 'ready', 'posting', 'completed', 'failed'
  next_post_time TIMESTAMP,
  engagement_score INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  story_category VARCHAR(100), -- 'founder_story', 'business_decision', etc.
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enhanced tweets table with thread relationships
ALTER TABLE tweets 
ADD COLUMN thread_id UUID REFERENCES threads(id),
ADD COLUMN thread_sequence INTEGER,
ADD COLUMN parent_twitter_id VARCHAR(100), -- For reply chains
ADD COLUMN content_type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'single_tweet',
ADD COLUMN hook_type VARCHAR(50); -- 'opener', 'context', 'crisis', 'resolution', 'lesson'

-- Performance indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_threads_next_post ON threads(status, next_post_time);
CREATE INDEX idx_threads_ready ON threads(account_id, status) WHERE status = 'ready';
CREATE INDEX idx_tweets_thread_sequence ON threads(thread_id, thread_sequence);
```

### Enhanced Persona System

  topics: [
    { key: 'startup_satire', displayName: 'Startup Culture Satire' },
    { key: 'business_irony', displayName: 'Business World Irony' },
    { key: 'tech_humor', displayName: 'Tech Industry Humor' }
  ],
  hashtag_sets: [
    ['#StartupLife', '#TechHumor', '#BusinessReality', '#Satire'],
    ['#Entrepreneurship', '#TechTwitter', '#StartupStruggles', '#Reality']
  ]
};

export const BUSINESS_STORYTELLER: PersonaConfig = {
  key: 'business_storyteller',
  displayName: 'Business Storyteller üìà',

    ['#StartupIndia', '#Jugaad', '#BusinessWisdom', '#Founders'],
    ['#FamilyBusiness', '#Succession', '#Legacy', '#Vision']
  ]
};
```

#### Content Mix Strategy for Prince Account
```typescript
// 60% Business Storyteller (threads), 30% Business Storyteller (single tweets), 10% Satirist
const princeGenerationPattern: HourlySchedule = {
  5: ['business_storyteller'],   // Morning thread
  9: ['business_storyteller'],   // Business hours thread  
  11: ['satirist'],              // Mid-morning satirical tweet
  14: ['business_storyteller'],  // Afternoon thread
  17: ['satirist'],              // Evening satirical tweet
  19: ['business_storyteller'],  // Evening thread

## 5-Minute Cron Integration

### Updated Cron Schedule
```bash
# Generation: Every 2 hours
0 */2 * * * GET https://yourapp.com/api/generate
Authorization: Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}

# Auto-posting: Every 5 minutes (CHANGED from hourly)
*/5 * * * * POST https://yourapp.com/api/auto-post
Authorization: Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}
```

### Enhanced Auto-Post Logic with Content Mix
```typescript
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const accountIds = getScheduledAccountIds();
  
  for (const accountId of accountIds) {
    // Priority 1: Active thread progression
    const activeThread = await getActiveThreadForPosting(accountId);
    if (activeThread && isTimeForNextTweet(activeThread)) {
      await postNextThreadTweet(activeThread);
      continue;
    }
    
    // Priority 2: Start new content (during posting schedule)
    if (isPostingScheduled(accountId)) {
      const eligibility = getPostingEligibility(accountId);
      
      // Check for ready threads
      const readyThreads = await getReadyThreads(accountId);
      if (readyThreads.length > 0 && eligibility.should_post) {
        await startThreadPosting(readyThreads[0]);
        continue;
      }
      
      // Fall back to single tweets (satirist + single business tweets + Gibbi unchanged)
      const readyTweets = await getReadyTweetsByAccount(accountId);
      if (readyTweets.length > 0 && eligibility.should_post) {
        await postSingleTweet(readyTweets[0]);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Parent Tweet ID Management

### Complete Reply Chain System
```typescript
async function startThreadPosting(thread: Thread) {
  const firstTweet = await getThreadTweet(thread.id, 1);
  
  const response = await postTweet({
    content: `${firstTweet.content}\n\n1/${thread.total_tweets} üßµ`,
    account_id: thread.account_id
  });
  
  // Store parent tweet ID and initialize thread posting
  await db.query(`
    UPDATE threads 
    SET status = 'posting',
        parent_tweet_id = $1,
        current_tweet = 2,
        next_post_time = NOW() + INTERVAL '5 minutes'
    WHERE id = $2
  `, [response.data.id, thread.id]);
  
  await updateTweetAfterPosting(thread.id, 1, response.data.id, null);
}

async function postNextThreadTweet(thread: Thread) {
  const nextTweet = await getThreadTweet(thread.id, thread.current_tweet);
  const previousTweet = await getLastPostedTweetInThread(thread.id);
  
  const response = await postTweet({
    content: `${nextTweet.content}\n\n${thread.current_tweet}/${thread.total_tweets} üßµ`,
    reply_to: previousTweet.twitter_id,
    account_id: thread.account_id
  });
  
  // Update thread progress
  const isLastTweet = thread.current_tweet >= thread.total_tweets;
  await db.query(`
    UPDATE threads 
    SET current_tweet = CASE WHEN $2 THEN current_tweet ELSE current_tweet + 1 END,
        next_post_time = CASE WHEN $2 THEN NULL ELSE NOW() + INTERVAL '5 minutes' END,
        status = CASE WHEN $2 THEN 'completed' ELSE status END
    WHERE id = $1
  `, [thread.id, isLastTweet]);
  
  await updateTweetAfterPosting(thread.id, thread.current_tweet, response.data.id, previousTweet.twitter_id);
}
```
